# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
In this project, As I am comparing with Louiseâ€™s play Fever  which is theater play. So I am just focusing on the theater plays.
I am trying to find out how many Theater campaigns faired to their launch dates and their funding goals and with this I found out how many campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
As part of the analysis, I considered only the theater data of all years and considering the plays that got successful, failed and canceled as per their goals. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
As part of this analysis, I observed that in all these years, maximum number of plays were successful especially during the month of May with count 111, then followed by Jun with 100 plays. Whereas,after month of May or specifically after Jun, the downfall started, i did got slightly better in Oct but after that it fell through. 

By the month of Dec, the number of successful and fail are the same and during the month of Oct of all these years they never had a single play that got canceled. It means on an average success rate are always better than failure.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
As part of this analysis, I observed that Maximum number of plays goals are in between Less than $1000 to $15k and on an average no. of successful plays are way more than the the failed and there are no canceled plays for all these categories.
But when I carefully observed, the on an average of successful percentage(47%) is less than the failure percentage(53%). 

In some category, the goals are either equal or slightly equal such as $10K to 15k, 15k to 20k and 20k to 25k, whereas in some cases the game if one sided specifically for goal $25 to $30K and $45k to 50K.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges I faced was to derive the columns for this analysis, like Parent category, subcategory and date created conversion and years. 

The main challenge was to to get 'date created conversion' column  as i have never created a date column with this formula.I referred couple of you tube tutorials videos to get the exact idea on how to get the right information.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) Overall, numbers of plays gets successful when launch during month of May and Jun.
2) End of 1st Quarter(Mar end) and 3rd Quarter(Sep end) hits the downfall.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
As per Outcomes based on Goals, I observed that mainly lower the goal has the higher chances of success and vice versa but also observed a consistent success between the goals amount $35k to 45k
After the goal from $45k to above, the chances of success are no to very less. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitation i felt was the reason of success , failure and canceled was not given to understand the data better.
It did not have the recent data, it had the data as of 2017. So do have the idea whether the scenario has changed or not in recent years

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1) As the requested analysis was mainly for plays but we can also check with which parent category has the overall success or failure on outcomes or may be by which country had the major success or failure in considering all parent categories.
2) We could have requested for yearly time line of plays outcomes instead of months time line of success and failure.
